When using knex to manage sqlite database with node webkit or electron projects it seems that knex has a very bad memory management,
this forks is enhanced by removing a lot of un necessary node modules such as "lodash" and rewrite the code using native javascript.

please use this project only with sqlite and nwjs or electron projects with new nodejs version 6 or higher, you can install it using the command

`npm install git+https://git@github.com/digital-flowers/knex.git`
 
 
for any information about how to use knex please visit the original project page https://github.com/tgriesser/knex
